# Digit Recognition using TensorFlow

## Project Overview
This project utilizes TensorFlow to create a convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for the recognition of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It includes detailed steps for data preprocessing, model construction, training, evaluation, and visualization of the model's performance.

## Installation
You can set up this project by cloning the repository
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PedramMadani/digit-recognition
   cd digit-recognition
```
and installing the required Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

``` bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Make sure you have Python installed, and then use pip to install the dependencies.

## Usage
Once the environment is set up, you can run the Jupyter notebook.
``` bash
    jupyter notebook Digit_recognition.ipynb
```
Just open the notebook in Jupyter and execute all cells to view the project in action, from data loading to model training and evaluation.
